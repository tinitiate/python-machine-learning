## ># What is Machine Learning?
## >* Machine learning is the aspect of computer science that enables computers 
## >  to learn without being explicitly programmed.

## >## How is Machine Learning implemented?
## >* *SUPERVISED LEARNING** Using data existing patterns along with additional
## >  attributes, to predict future patterns.
## >* *UNSUPERVISED LEARNING** here the training data consists of a set of 
## >  input vectors x without any corresponding target values. The objective here is 
## >  to discover groups of similar examples within the data.

## >## SUPERVISED LEARNING
## >* Supervised Learning is the concept of machine learning, where predictions
## >  happens using **TRAINING DATASET**
## >* The TRAINING DATASET is madeup of inputs and classified outputs.
## >* The INPUTs are called vectors and OUTPUTs are called supervisory signal.
## >* The mapping between the INPUT and OUTPUT is done through a MAPPING FUNCTION,
## >  Such that OUTPUT = MappingFunction(INPUT).
## >* The objective in this approach is to make the algorithm of "MappingFunction"
## >  to generate values same as expected outputs.

## >### Supervised Learning - Classification
## >* **CLASSIFICATION** is the concept of **SUPERVISED LEARNING** where the objective
## >  of the machine learning program is to `classify input data into a category`.
## >* Some applications of **Supervised Learning - Classification**, say would be;
## >  Classify an image of a person as male or female.

## >### Supervised Learning - Regression
## >* **REGRESSION** is the concept of **SUPERVISED LEARNING** where the objective
## >  of the machine learning program is to `predict a real value`, such as a dollar 
## >  value in other currencies, or a days weather in temprature or stock prices.

## >## UNSUPERVISED LEARNING
## >* `Unsupervised Machine Learning`
## >* This is machine learning without any reference to lookup for possible or expected
## >  output as the objective of learning, only input data is provided.
## >* `Unsupervised Machine Learning` could be called as true artificial intelligence
## >  where a computer processes the data and learns to identify patterns within data
## >  without any guidance (either human input or source data).
## >* Unsupervised learning is acheived by two basic concepts clustering and association.
## >* `CLUSTERING`
## >  * Since there is no guidance data or lookup data, The idea of Clustering breaks
## >    input data into data subsets or clusters with similar data characterstics.
## >* `ASSOCIATION`
## >  * Association rule learning is a method for discovering relations between data 
## >    elements, which have common patterns to deduce other data.
## >  * Identifying pairs of data Soda an Popcorn at a movie theater, or Shoe and polish.

## >## REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
## >* This is unsupervised way of achieving learning trough trial and error.
## >* The goal of learning is defined as a state that is arrived by trial and 
## >  error(estimation).
## >* The outcomes are usually random.
